## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky Blue (#87CEEB) for a clean, informative feel.
- Background color: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) with a desaturated hue to reduce visual clutter.
- Accent color: Pale Green (#98FB98) to highlight interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers, 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body.  'Space Grotesk' provides a techy feel, while 'Inter' supports readability for longer text blocks.
- The layout should incorporate CSS glassmorphism over a gradient background, using a flex-direction: column, centered on the page.
- Employ clear, professional icons for map features and analysis tools to ensure user-friendliness.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions when loading map layers or performing analysis to enhance the user experience.
